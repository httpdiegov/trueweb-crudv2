## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#468499) evokes a sense of sophistication and luxury, befitting high-quality garments.
- Background color: Light gray (#E0E3E3), provides a neutral backdrop to make the clothing items pop.
- Accent color: Pale blue (#74A2B3), complementary, offering a calming contrast to the teal.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', sans-serif. Body font: 'Alegreya', serif. Choose 'Belleza' for its modern style and elegance for titles and important texts. Pair it with 'Alegreya' to give clarity and readability to large blocks of text.
- Use a consistent style for icons, focusing on simple, outlined icons for categories and filters.
- Clean, grid-based layout to showcase products effectively.
